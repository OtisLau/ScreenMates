# Testing Background Sync

##  Goal
Verify that your app uploads block data to CloudKit even when it's **closed**, not just when you open it.

---

##  Test Method 1: Simple Test (Recommended)

### Step 1: Setup
1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Complete onboarding** (permissions, username, group)
3. **Open Debug Menu** (Settings → Debug Menu)
4. **Note current values:**
   - Daily Blocks Used: `X`
   - Last Background Sync: `(none yet)`

### Step 2: Use Tracked Apps
1. **Close ScreenMates** completely (swipe up from app switcher)
2. **Open tracked apps** (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
3. **Use them for 5+ minutes** (accumulate ~5 blocks in test mode)
4. **Wait 15-20 minutes** (for background task to run)

### Step 3: Check Results
1. **Don't open ScreenMates yet!**
2. **Check CloudKit Dashboard** or ask a friend to check their leaderboard
3. **Your blocks should have updated** even though app was closed
4. **Now open ScreenMates**
5. **Go to Debug Menu** → Check "Last Background Sync"
6. **Tap "Sync History"** → See the background sync events

###  Success Criteria
- Last Background Sync shows a recent timestamp
- Sync History shows entries while app was closed
- Friend sees your updated blocks without you opening the app

##  Test Method 2: Simulator Test (Advanced)

### Setup Background Task Simulation
1. **Run app in Xcode Simulator**
2. **Complete onboarding**
3. **Use tracked apps to get some blocks**
4. **Close the app** (Home button)

### Trigger Background Task Manually
5. **In Xcode, open Debug menu** → Simulate Background Fetch
6. **Or use terminal command:**
   ```bash
   e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.otishlau.screenmates.refresh"]
   ```

### Verify
7. **Check Xcode console** for:
   - ` Background task triggered at ...`
   - ` Background Sync: Uploaded X blocks`
8. **Open app** → Debug Menu → Check sync history

##  Test Method 3: Real Device Test (Most Reliable)

### Why Real Device?
- Simulators don't reliably test background tasks
- Real devices follow actual iOS scheduling
- More accurate real-world behavior

### Steps
1. **Install on physical iPhone/iPad**
2. **Complete setup**
3. **Use tracked apps for 2-3 minutes** (get 2-3 blocks)
4. **Force quit ScreenMates**
5. **Put device in your pocket** (don't touch it for 20+ minutes)
6. **OR: Lock device and charge it** (iOS prefers to run bg tasks while charging)
7. **After 20+ minutes, open app**
8. **Check Debug Menu** → "Last Background Sync"
9. **Should show sync happened while app was closed**

###  Debugging Tips
- Background tasks run more frequently when **device is charging**
- iOS may delay tasks if **battery is low**
- Tasks won't run if **Low Power Mode** is enabled
- **First bg task** might take 30+ mins after initial app close

---

##  Reading the Sync History

### Green Checkmark 
- Sync succeeded
- Data uploaded to CloudKit
- Friends can see your updated blocks

### Red X 
- Sync failed
- Possible causes:
  - No internet connection
  - CloudKit unavailable
  - iCloud not signed in

### Timestamp
- Shows **exact time** background task ran
- Should be **while app was closed**
- Multiple entries = multiple successful syncs

### Blocks Count
- Shows how many blocks were uploaded
- Should match your usage at that time

---

##  Understanding Background Tasks

### How It Works
1. **App goes to background** → schedules task for 15 min later
2. **iOS decides when to run it** (might not be exactly 15 min)
3. **Task wakes up** → reads UserDefaults
4. **Uploads to CloudKit** → logs the sync
5. **Repeats** when app enters background again

### iOS Scheduling Rules
-  **Runs more often** when device is charging
-  **Runs more often** when on WiFi vs cellular
-  **Delayed or skipped** if battery is low
-  **Never runs** in Low Power Mode
-  **Might delay** if you're actively using device

### Typical Behavior
- **Best case:** Task runs every 15-20 minutes
- **Typical case:** Task runs every 30-60 minutes
- **Worst case:** Task runs once per hour or less

##  Debug Menu Features

### View Background Sync Status
- **Last Background Sync** - When did it last run?
- **Sync History** - See all sync events with timestamps
- **Success/Failure** - Check if syncs are working

### Manual Testing
- **Force Sync Now** - Manually upload (tests network)
- **Clear Local Data** - Reset and test from scratch

---

##  Troubleshooting

### "No background syncs yet"
**Possible causes:**
- App hasn't been backgrounded long enough
- iOS hasn't scheduled the task yet
- Try closing app and waiting 30+ minutes

**Solutions:**
- Make sure device is charging
- Disable Low Power Mode
- Wait longer (first bg task can take time)
- Test on real device, not simulator

### "Syncs showing but blocks not updating"
**Possible causes:**
- CloudKit sync is working, but blocks not incrementing
- DeviceActivity extension not running

**Solutions:**
- Use tracked apps (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Check "Daily Blocks Used" in Debug Menu
- Verify apps are selected in Screen Time settings

### "All syncs showing as failed (red X)"
**Possible causes:**
- No internet connection
- Not signed into iCloud
- CloudKit container issue

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Sign into iCloud (Settings → Your Name)
- Verify iCloud Drive is enabled

##  Success Indicators

You know background sync is working when:
1.  "Last Background Sync" shows recent time (while app was closed)
2.  Sync History shows multiple entries over time
3.  Friend sees your blocks update without you opening the app
4.  Timestamps in history are spaced 15-60 minutes apart
5.  Most syncs show green checkmarks (success)

---

##  Pro Tips

### Best Conditions for Testing
-  Device plugged in and charging
-  Connected to WiFi
-  Low Power Mode OFF
-  App has been closed for 30+ minutes
-  Device not in active use

### Quick Test
1. Use tracked apps for 3 minutes (get 3 blocks)
2. Close ScreenMates completely
3. Plug in device and lock it
4. Wait 30 minutes
5. Open app → Debug Menu → Check sync history
6. Should see a successful sync with 3 blocks

### Continuous Monitoring
- Ask a friend to watch your leaderboard position
- Use tracked apps while ScreenMates is closed
- Friend should see your blocks increase
- This proves background sync is working!

##  Summary

**To test background sync:**
1. Use tracked apps to get blocks
2. Close ScreenMates completely  
3. Wait 20-30 minutes (device charging helps)
4. Open app → Settings → Debug Menu
5. Check "Last Background Sync" and "Sync History"

**You'll know it's working when you see sync events that happened while the app was closed!**
