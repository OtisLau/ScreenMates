- **Gear icon:** Open settings

### What Gets Tracked
- Every minute you use selected apps = 1 block (test mode)
- Data syncs to CloudKit automatically
- Friends see your usage in real-time

### Notifications
You'll get notified when:
- You reach 75% of daily limit (9/12 blocks)
- You reach 90% of daily limit (11/12 blocks)
- You go over the limit
- New day starts (with streak update)

##  Settings

### Profile
- **Edit Name:** Change your display name
- **View IDs:** See your user ID and group ID

### Notifications
- **Toggle:** Enable/disable notifications
- **Settings Link:** Open iOS Settings if permission needed

### Group Actions
- **Leave Group:** Exit current group (confirmation required)

### App Actions
- **Reset App:** Delete all data and start over (confirmation required)

### Debug Menu
- **View Data:** See UserDefaults and CloudKit values
- **Manual Sync:** Force upload/download now
- **Midnight Reset:** Simulate next day (reset blocks to 0)
- **Test Notification:** Send test notification
- **Clear Data:** Remove local cached data

---

##  Test Mode

### Current Settings
- **1 minute = 1 block** (for easy testing)
- **Daily goal:** 12 blocks (12 minutes)

### To Test:
1. Open tracked apps (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
2. Use for 1 minute
3. Check dashboard → blocks should increment
4. Wait 60 seconds for auto-refresh, or pull-to-refresh

### To Switch to Production Mode:
Edit `AppConstants.swift`:
```swift
static let currentBlockSize = 15 // Change from 1 to 15
static let isTestMode = false // Change from true to false
```
This makes 15 minutes = 1 block (production setting)

### For Privacy
- App never tracks WHICH apps you use
- Only tracks TOTAL TIME spent
- No screenshots or activity logs
- You control what's tracked
